Case 2: The Proctor That Sees Ghosts 👀

What’s happening:
During online exams, an AI watches students’ webcams. If it detects too much eye movement or looking away, it flags them as possible cheaters.

What’s problematic (the four red flags):

.Fairness: Neurodivergent students or those with anxiety get flagged unfairly just for behaving differently.

.Transparency: Students aren’t told exactly what triggers a flag — it feels arbitrary and scary.

.Privacy: Constant webcam monitoring records highly personal behavior and environments, raising surveillance concerns.

.Accountability: If the AI wrongly accuses a student, who clears their name? The AI has no appeals desk.

Improvement idea:
Use the AI as a helper, not a judge. Let it flag “unusual” behavior, but require a human proctor review before labeling someone as cheating. Schools should also publish clear guidelines on what the AI tracks and ensure students consent to this monitoring.
