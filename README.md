# Assignment Brief (student-facing)

You’re now a Responsible AI Inspector 🕵️‍♂️. Your job is to investigate how AI is used in a scenario, spot anything suspicious (bias? lack of transparency?), and help fix it. You'll be given 2 short cases.

Your mission:
Describe what the AI is doing.
Spot what could go wrong (hint: check fairness, privacy, accountability...)
Suggest 1 way to improve it responsibly.
🎨 Bonus points if you write your answer like a short blog post explaining the issue in a fun and clear way.
Think of it as being a detective — but make it vibe. 


🗂️ Example Scenario Prompts
Hiring Bot: A company uses an AI to screen job applicants. It tends to reject more female applicants with career gaps.
School Proctoring AI: A system flags students as "cheating" based on eye movement — but it often flags neurodivergent students.
